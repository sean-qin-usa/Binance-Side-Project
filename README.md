Project from September 2024 - April 2025
Data used was 1s samples from 2025 on BTC and ETH from the Binance website. 
While the model itself doesn't seem to generate positive returns (even pre-fees and live implementation), this was still a valuable learning experience in data processing, data analysis, modelling (specifically financial models), machine learning (OLS), as well as learning to debug efficiently and format code cleanly to an industry standard. 
I look forward to future projects which may build on the skills cultivated here as well as new ventures into the coding and financial industry.
